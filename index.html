                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Goal-oriented and enthusiastic person willing to become a FrontEnd developer. Last year I found my passion for creating websites. Since then I am a determined learner of *HTML/CSS* and *JS*. It is important for me to enjoy my work, so I hope to become a programmer. Because it's always fun and meaningful to learn and create something new, and I definitely won't get tired of it.

                <h2>English</h2>
                <p>I've been learning English language since 1st grade. I've had lessons for 5 academical hours a week during school period and then 6 hours a week in university. Also I had been working as a teacher for first graders for half a year in <a href="https://addrian.school/">Addrian School</a>.</p>
                <p>For now I maintain my language skills by reading books, watching movies and using <a href="https://www.busuu.com/ru">Busuu</a> mobile app. I also have a few friends from different countries with whom we communicate in English every day. Unfortunately, I don't have much speaking practice these days, but I hope I will be able to visit my friends in Canada soon and gain more speaking experience.</p>
