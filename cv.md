## About me 
Goal-oriented and enthusiastic person struggling for becoming a **FrontEnd developer**. Last year I found my passion for creating websites. Since then I am a determined learner of *HTML/CSS* and *JS*. It is important for me to enjoy my work, so I hope to become a programmer. Because it's always fun and meaningful to learn and create something new, and I definitely won't get tired of it.

## Code example
~~~
const kelvin = 354
let celsius = kelvin - 273
let fahrenheit = celsius * (9/5) + 32
fahrenheit = Math.floor(fahrenheit)
console.log(`The temperature is ${fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit.`)
let newton = celsius * (33/100)
newton = Math.floor(newton)
console.log(`The temperature is ${newton} degrees Newton.`)

## English
I've been learning English language since 1st grade. I've had lessons for 5 academical hours a week during school period and then 6 hours a week in university. Also I had been working as a teacher for first graders for half a year in [Addrian School](https://addrian.school/).
For now I maintain my language skills by reading books, watching movies and using [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/ru) mobile app. I also have a few friends from different countries with whom we communicate in English every day. Unfortunately, I don't have much speaking practice these days, but I hope I will be able to visit my friends in Canada soon and gain more speaking experience.
